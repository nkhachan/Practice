A path of execution within a process (a single process can contain many threads)

Threads vs Processes
  - threads have a shared memory space, while processes have different ones
  - threads share data section, OS resources, code sections
  - Threads have their own Program counter, register set, and stack pointer

Advantages to threads
  - Output of execution immediately returned.
  - Faster Context Switching
  - Communication between threads is easier
  - Share resources
  - Higher throughput

Types of threads
  - Kernel Level
  - User Level
