Stack :
-static memory allocation
-easily accessible (fast access)
-stores local variables (intrinsic types and references to objects, pointers)

Heap :
-dynamic memory allocation
-stores objects


Object* o = new Object();
pointer o is on stack pointing to location on Heap where the object exists.

Note : when the pointer is deleted, the object's destructor is called.
