Only difference betwen class and struct in C++ is the fact
that default accessibility in struct is public whereas default in class
is private.


Basic Inheritence is the following :

// Parent Class
class Shape {
   public:
    void setColor(string aColor){
      color = aColor;
    }

   protected:
    string color;
};

// Child Class
class Rectangle: public Shape {
  public:
    void setHeight(int aHeight){
      height = aHeight;
    }
    void setWidth(int aWidth){
      width = aWidth;
    }
  protected:
    int width;
    int height;
};

Access      	  public	protected	private
Same class	    yes	    yes	      yes
Derived classes	yes	    yes 	    no
Outside classes	yes	    no	      no

Derived classes DO NOT inherit :
Constructors/Destructors/Copy Constructors
